# FMEA-Based
This project is a simple web-based system designed to evaluate and manage risks in blood donation and transfusion processes using the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) methodology.
Users can input potential failure modes, rate them by severity, occurrence, and detectability, and the system automatically calculates the Risk Priority Number (RPN). A dashboard visualizes high-risk areas using interactive charts, and reports can be exported for documentation or analysis.

    Automatic RPN calculation
    Statistical summary (average, max, min RPN, high-risk count)
